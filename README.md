# Investicity

Are you trying to get started with investing but dont know how? Do you like building cities and earning achievements? Or maybe you just wish to have a space to talk with other investors?
Well if you fit at least two of them come give our app a try!

Our app gamifies investing by giving you a currency called gems for every $100 you earn from investing in a day! These gems are used in the 'City' Section where you can build, well a city, starting from the famous NYC to Moon Bases! If you think that gems are too easy to obtain, well you're right, but only for the first city. Every subsequent city will have an exponential increase in the amount required to earn in a day to obtain a gem. From $200 in city #2 to a whopping $12800 in city #8! Our team believes that this helps users be more motivated in trying to invest in smarter options to earn more and be able to build more cities.

## Design Process

We first came up with the idea of using money earned from investing to build cities from an app that was showcased to us a day prior to the IP meeting called future city (pardon me if im wrong). During the breakdown of 'Future City' one of the conclusions was that it simply was not made properly. The idea was that users would put how much they have spent that day into the day, earning them in-game points that can be used to build the city, however, the user could very well just input however much they want and rack up a huge number of points in a day. It also doesnt exactly serve its purpose well in that it could be seen as encouraging people to spend money. Learning from this, our team thought that earning money would be a better base to start with and built from there into a stocks trading/ investing app. This app would be mainly targeted towards people who are new to investing as this would help cultivate good investing habits early on using the gamifies system. 

## Features

Our App features a simple stock trading system similar to other apps like moomoo where you can buy and sell stocks, or send them to another user, perhaps a friend. We also have a community tab where you can either chat with other users on perhaps the best ways to invest, or create your own channel and give advice to newbies. If you want to check your history in case you forgot if you sent your friend owed money, dont worry because we have the activity tab that tracks all transactions, be it buy, sell or sending. Since our app values security, we would inevitably have to use the long user IDs when you are sending someone money using our app. However, we added a feature that generates a qr code that contains all necessary information about the transfer so the recepient can just scan and recieve! For the unique aspect of our app, we have a city page where users can build their own cities using in-game currency awarded based on how much you have earned through investing on that particular day. This currency is used to buy and construct the buildings that make up the city.

## Existing Features

City - Allows users to spend in-game currency earned through investing to build cities
Community - Allows users to talk with other users to gain insight or give advice in relations to investing
Qr Code generator - For convenience users can use this to forgo the tedious inputting of numbers when transferring money

## Features left to implement

More complex graphs for serious stock investors to view since the current graphs are made easier for people who are new to investing to understand
